# WGS pathwrap tool
Pathwrap is a VCF analysis tool for whole genome analysis that provides a wrapper for the processing of WGS datasets from quality control of raw reads to the visualization of enriched pathwys obtained from processing the datasets. This tool runs all the essential steps of RNAseq processing from quality control, filtering out low quality reads, trimming adapters, sequence alignemnt, alignment count, differential analysis, enrichemnt analysis and pathway visualization. It is the first tool that combines all essential steps of WGS analysis till pathway visualization.

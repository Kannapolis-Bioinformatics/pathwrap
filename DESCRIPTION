Description:
    Pathviewwrap is a RNASeq analysis tool that provides a wrapper
    for the processing of RNASeq datasets from quality control of raw
    reads to the visualization of enriched pathways obtained from processing 
    the datasets. This tool runs all the essential steps of RNASeq processing
    from quality control, filtering out low quality reads, trimming adapters,
    sequence alignment, alignment count, differential analysis, enrichment 
    analysis and pathway visualization. It is the first tool that combines 
    all essential steps of RNASeq analysis till pathway visualization. It has
    the ability to continue the analysis if it is halted at any stage and 
    generate quality pictures and generate comprehensive analysis of the data.
